# Torch

Basic implementation for the main modules of PyTorch. For educational purposes only. 

See `test/` directory for example usage.

# TODO

- [x] Implement `autograd` module to support arithmetic operations on scalars.
- [ ] Simple implementation of `optim` and `nn` modules.
- [ ] Visualizing the computational graph.
- [ ] N-dimensional arrays (Tensors) instead of scalars.
- [ ] Add Tensor operations.
- [ ] Implement `nn` module and `optim` to support Tensors and N-dimensional inputs.
